<p><i>AutoBiography</i> is a completely immersive and site specific multimedia and multisensory performance that investigates and celebrates the meaning of cars in all our lives. It is inspired by Richard Wagner’s Ring Cycle, his concept of Gesamtkunstwerk, which merges multiple art forms and senses, and our own life stories that all somehow and somewhere involve cars.</p>

<p>Keep your eyes peeled this October for issue 1 of the limited edition AutoBiography magazine.</p>
