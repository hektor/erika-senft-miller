<p><i>AutoBiography</i> is a completely immersive and site specific multimedia performance in Burlington's Marketplace Parking garage between Bank street and Cherry street. The performance is inspired by Richard Wagnerâ€™s Ring-cycle, his concept of Gesamtkunstwerk which merges multiple artforms and senses, and our own life stories that all somehow and somewhere involve cars.</p>
