_Bucking_ is the fourth of an eight scene performance structured around the process of making cordwood. Each of the seven dancers of Erika Miller Performance Lab developed a choreographic score for this performance.

Just like a bucked tree, the sections together create the whole but it will only be seen in divided parts. An exploration of deconstructing and reconstructing in order to understand the whole. How many parts do we need to see in order to create a whole story?
