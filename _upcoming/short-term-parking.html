<p><i>In Short Term Parking</i>, the next layer of <a href="/projects/autobiography"><i>Autobiography: A Car Opera in Five Acts</i></a>, Erika Senft Miller and her collaborators, invite you to explore and play with cars in entirely unexpected new ways. This is a brief opportunity to reimagine your AutoBiography in play.</p>

<p>The multimedia installation in and around the <b>Karma Bird House Gallery</b>, located at 47 Maple Street, Burlington, Vermont, features the work of nine artists and will include photos, videos, scent experiences, video games, VR and immersive sculpture from the November 4 performance <i>AutoBiography: A Car Opera in Five Acts</i> and the entirely new, “Scratch-and-Sniff Car Doors” with custom scents by Aaron Wisniewski of Alice & the Magician.</p>

<p>In case you missed the opera or couldn’t get inside the cars, here is your opportunity to experience and re-experience Act 3 St(r)atus Quo/Siegfried: Burlington-based musician Ivamae will perform original music inside the immersive car sculpture by Senft Miller, Aaron Stein and Lydia Kern, parked in front of the gallery.</p>

<p>Artists participating in Short Term Parking (which consistent with its theme will be parked at the gallery only through May 5th) include: filmmaker Will Cottiss will screen a short, narrative film featuring biographical footage from attendees of the Car Opera and Jude Domski will be showing an original Car Opera film in the vault room, Kelly Holt and Renee Greenlee, will show photography inspired by custom scents crafted for the Car Opera by Alice & the Magician.</p>

<p>“I’m fascinated by the way you organize components of a dream into a narrative for interpretation,” Senft Miller says. “The Car Opera, that we created last November, was the dream. Now, with Short Term Parking, these nine artists and I are diving into the molecular layers of the dream.”</p>

<p><i>AutoBiography Magazine</i>, a collection of photographs and essays, and AutoBiography mechanics jackets from the November performance will be for sale at the exhibition.</p>
