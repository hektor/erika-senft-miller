<p>The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/erikamillerlab/" target="_blank">Erika Miller Performance Lab</a> is excited to share with you <i>OffSiteOnTime Scene 6:
Stacking</i>. The 90-minute outdoor performance is the sixth in a series of eight works inspired by
SiteTime, a collaborative residency at the Vermont Arts Council that began in 2017. The
residency focused on the lifecycle of cordwood, and this outgrowth has shifted to become an
examination of the specific terms associated with that process: Felling, limbing, bucking, splitting
and now, stacking.</p>

<p>Please stop by on March 5 any time between 5:15 and 6:45 p.m. at 47 Maple Street for <i>Scene
6: Stacking</i>. Our performance examines the idea of stacking not just as it relates to firewood,
but to other energy sources and technologies. Drop in for as short or as long as you like as we
play with the experience of layering movement, data, sites, times, questions, concepts…you get
the idea.</p>

<p><b>Where do I watch from?</b></p>
<p>The performance will be on the sidewalk. You, the audience, can explore it from different
vantage points: as a drive through show from your car; as a pedestrian sharing space with the
dancers; or peeking out from the windows of Maglianero cafe.</p>

<p><b>What is the series about?</b></p>
<p>The OffSiteOnTime series is a mixture of performance and installation. With each iteration we
explore our role as performers, while the audience is invited to contemplate what it means to
view a work of art. Is that dualism — performer and audience — obsolete? Do we need new
terminology? Or maybe just a new way of regarding the role of the audience, which is the
particular fascination of this project.</p>

<p><b>Why is it so long? Do I stay for the whole thing?</b></p>
<p>Most comfortable performances clock in at 60 minutes. Scene 6, and every other OffSiteOnTime
performance, is 90 minutes long. That runtime not only allows us space to explore and move,
but also challenges the audience to determine for themselves how they will view us. Will you
take a short glimpse? Drop in twice? View from different angles? Or will you stay and
experience the full cycle of movement from just one position? And, finally, how is any one of
those modes of viewing different than how you would absorb a 60-minute play?</p>
