<p>Get ready for <i>AutoBiography</i>, an opera about cars, the people who use them and the archetypal stories they tell. The five act, one hour opera takes place in Burlington’s Marketplace Garage on Sunday, Nov. 1 from 1-8 p.m. Start at Handy’s Service Center (open till 7 p.m.), pick up a program for $3, and follow the path through the show all the way to Lucky Next Door. You’ll encounter music, movement, installation and surprising scents. Hang onto your program! It’s your ticket to a free cup of coffee at the LND after party/exhibit (open until 8:30 p.m.) AutoBiography is produced by Erika Senft Miller and Burlington City Arts, in collaboration with Aaron Stein, Leif Hunneman and Matt LaRocca. The performance is sponsored by Dealer.com and others.</p>
