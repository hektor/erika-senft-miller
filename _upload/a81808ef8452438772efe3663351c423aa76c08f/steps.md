**When uploading a photo**  only use **.jpg** and **.png** image types, make sure that these files are **below 1mb** and saved for web (photos from your cell phone are great!). Only relevant images will be accepted.

**To add a Video** we can only accept Vimeo videos. It is free to **[make an account](https://vimeo.com/log_in)** and host your videos. If you would prefer not to create a Vimeo account you can **email your video** to admin@erikasenftmiller.com and we will host it for you.

**To add some text** simply type or paste your text in the field provided. You could add something you thought at a performance, a reflection or a question you asked, or perhaps some notes you took.
