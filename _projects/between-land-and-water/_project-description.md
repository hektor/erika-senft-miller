Between Land and Water was an exploration of liminality—the time or place where you are too far to return, yet not far enough to see where you will arrive. The piece sought to invite people to rethink how they interact with the Burlington waterfront, a staple of the city’s cultural landscape and a place full of joyful opportunity beyond its sublime sunsets. The concept was inspired by the Lake Champlain Community Sailing Center, a pillar of education that promotes water sports and activities along with the responsible stewardship of Lake Champlain. 

The performance drew upon over forty local dancers, sailors, swimmers, and paddle boarders who moved to the adaptive and improvisational work of area musicians. The unpredictable nature of the weather allowed the lake to play its own unexpected role. Shot from air, land, and water, footage from the performance was displayed as part of BCA’s Of Land and Local exhibit at Shelburne Farms, at which pieces from the dock held up video monitors while a boat sail acted as a projection surface. The contrast between the serenely bucolic Shelburne Farms and the heavily industrial Sailing Center was juxtaposed against the sites’ shared watershed and connection to the lake.
