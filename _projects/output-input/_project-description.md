We are both the input and the output–the subject and the object–the message and the messenger. Sending and receiving signals, passing information from eyes to hands, hands to screen, screen to server, and back again. These signals give shape to our environments–forming identities, relationships, communities, and networks. A blurry swarm of processes and feedback loops, transforming through constant gestures. We pause and save, we get up and stretch. When the technical is natural and the digital becomes physical do our bodies become translators or devices? Do we shape our environments or do they shape us? What is website-specific?

*Code from the program we created that generates a random question from a predetermined list of questions, and allows users to press a key on a keyboard to submit their answer.*

When we designed the website that you are currently using, we asked ourselves a lot of questions about what it could mean to be "website-specific." Once the website was ready, we reflected on our process and what we had just built and we created an extension of the site at the Karma Bird House gallery. 

A computer was installed inside a former bank vault, and 32 sf. of grass was rolled out into the vault. In the middle of the room was a keyboard and nothing more, on the end was a floating 17" screen. For 10 days, visitors were encouraged to interact with the work through a series of random prompts and questions in the form of note cards and randomly generated questions on screen.
