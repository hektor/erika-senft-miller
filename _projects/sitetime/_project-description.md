*SiteTime* is an ongoing site-specific series that will evolve over a two year long residency at the Vermont Arts Council. Created in collaboration with Michael Zebrowski and Nancy Winship Milliken, the work will be exhibited at VAC’s outdoor sculpture garden. At the core of the installation is a stack of cordwood sourced from Hardwick, Vermont representative of what a family might burn throughout a single winter for warmth. The cordwood will remain at the site throughout consecutive showings of eight scenes that will include performances, sculpture, multimedia, and other yet to be announced activations. The stack, which will shift and evolve over time due to human and environmental forces, aims to draw connections to the working landscape of Vermont and the interplay between natural growth and utility.

Scene one: *Slumping* 

The first scene, called “slumping,” was titled in reference to the pile of firewood slumping or settling over time. Miller and the Movement Lab lay still on their backs on gravel. Their breath and unwavered attention were doing the opposite as they were each balancing a large branch of driftwood like a calder mobile. Their training and rehearsal consisted of Alexander technique (of which Miller is a certified teacher) and other exercises inspired by Japanese Butoh dance practice. A few feet away, Milliken and her husband divided the attention of the audience and generated a rhythm to the piece by restacking the cordwood pile. The connection between the quiescent wood and the slight movements of the performers connected the entirety of the work through a conflictingly rousing minimalism—a call to the torpid yet steady communication that occurs between trees.

Scene two: *Falling*
