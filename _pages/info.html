        <div class="col-12"><p>Including five languages; seventeen relocations; and twenty years teaching at universities, theaters, design studios, and other art and community centers; Miller’s life has been as dynamic and site-specific as her creative output. The boundary between her art and the rest of her life is something she has never considered to be a necessary distinction, always furthering the nuances of her creative process regardless of set and setting. In her words, “To work is to play; to play is to work.” Whether through her early ventures into advertising; training with Fe Reichelt; touring with the Panoptikum Movement Theater Company; or personally examining new movement forms like parkour, bouldering, or surfing; she continues to absorb her environment and connect place, experience, and culture. All the while, her work and her life are guided and propelled by her strongly-held belief that all of us become “a new person every two hours.”</p><p>Recently, Miller has partnered with a core group of collaborators that have joined her Movement Lab to work on a variety of projects including Site Time, Powered by Moran, Salt and Between Land and Water. The current members of the Movement Lab are: Shenita Sousa, Jacques Thach, Sheron Cairns, Jenniffer Harper and Denyse Dombrowski.</p>
