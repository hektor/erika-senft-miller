*Output / Input* was a convergence of dance, paint, sound, space, and skate. It was an homage to site; to the act of showing up; to the skate trick practiced again and again; to the small gaps of time when creativity is possible in the midst of a life in motion. The concept was inspired by artist Clark Derbes’ paintings on an abandoned stretch of I-89 that serves as an unofficial skate park for locals. He created the work while his baby napped nearby in a stroller, prompting Miller’s exploration and relating to her own experience of writing her doctorate research on “Play and the Creative Process” while her young daughter was napping. The common ground of their experiences highlights how the creative process can thrive even in the smallest slivers of space and time.
